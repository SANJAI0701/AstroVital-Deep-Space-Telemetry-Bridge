# AstroVital-Deep-Space-Telemetry-Bridge
AstroVital is a full-stack biomedical telemetry system designed to simulate the monitoring of astronaut vital signs during Extravehicular Activities (EVAs). It bridges the gap between embedded hardware (Space Suit) and mission control software using IoT protocols optimized for high-latency environments.
